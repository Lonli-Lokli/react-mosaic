description: Review a specific component in the library
---

Review the React component file you specify. The review should cover:

1. Code quality and best practices
2. TypeScript type safety
3. React patterns and hooks usage
4. Performance considerations
5. Accessibility concerns
6. Potential bugs or edge cases
7. Documentation and comments
8. Suggested improvements

Ask me which component file to review (e.g., Mosaic.tsx, MosaicWindow.tsx, etc.).
