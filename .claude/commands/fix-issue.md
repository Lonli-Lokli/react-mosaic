description: Debug and fix an issue in the codebase
---

I'll help you debug and fix an issue in the react-mosaic codebase.

Describe the issue you're experiencing, including:
- What behavior you're seeing
- What behavior you expected
- Steps to reproduce (if applicable)
- Error messages (if any)

I will then:

1. Investigate the relevant code
2. Identify the root cause
3. Propose a solution
4. Implement the fix
5. Add tests to prevent regression
