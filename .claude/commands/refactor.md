description: Refactor code for better quality or maintainability
---

I'll help you refactor code in the react-mosaic project.

Tell me what you want to refactor:
- A specific file or component
- A particular pattern or approach
- Code duplication
- Performance optimization
- Type safety improvements

I will:

1. Analyze the current implementation
2. Identify improvement opportunities
3. Propose a refactoring plan
4. Implement the changes while maintaining functionality
5. Ensure all tests still pass
6. Update related documentation
