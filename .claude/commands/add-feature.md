description: Plan and implement a new feature
---

I'll help you plan and implement a new feature for react-mosaic.

First, describe the feature you want to add. I will then:

1. Analyze the existing codebase to understand relevant patterns
2. Create a detailed implementation plan
3. Identify files that need to be modified or created
4. Implement the feature following existing code conventions
5. Add appropriate tests
6. Update documentation if needed

What feature would you like to add?
