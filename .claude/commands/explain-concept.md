Explain a core concept of the react-mosaic library. I can explain:

1. **Tree Structure**: How the n-ary tree layout works
2. **Path System**: How paths identify nodes in the tree
3. **Drag & Drop**: How the drag-and-drop system is implemented
4. **Split Nodes**: How split containers divide space
5. **Tab Nodes**: How tabbed interfaces work
6. **Context API**: How components communicate via React context
7. **Tree Updates**: How immutable tree updates work
8. **Migration**: How legacy binary trees are converted to n-ary

Which concept would you like me to explain?
